The next morning at daybreak, Star flew indoors, seemingly keen for a lesson.
I said,“Tap eight.” She did a brilliant exhibition, first tapping it in 4, 4, then giving
me a hasty glance and doing it in 2, 2, 2, 2, before coming for her nut.
It is astonishing that Star learned to count up to 8 with no difficulty, and of
her own accord discovered that each number could be given with various different
divisions, this leaving no doubt that she was consciously thinking each number.
In fact, she did mental arithmetic, although unable, like humans, to name the
numbers. But she learned to recognize their spoken names almost immediately
and was able to remember the sounds of the names. Star is unique as a wild bird,
who of her own free will pursued the science of numbers with keen interest and
astonishing intelligence.
